    "The [geopandas library](https://geopandas.org/) is an easy-to-use, powerful data analysis toolkit for working with geospatial data. It extends the capabilities of pandas to allow spatial operations on geometric types. The development of geopandas started in 2013 and it is now maintained by an active developer community.\n",
    "\n",
    "geopandas is a \"high-level\" package, which means that it makes use of several other packages in the background. It combines the performance of powerful Python libraries such as [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [shapely](https://shapely.readthedocs.io/), [fiona](https://fiona.readthedocs.io/), and [pyproj](https://pyproj4.github.io/).\n",

    "In pandas, table-like data are stored in two-dimensional `DataFrame` objects with labeled rows and columns. The pandas DataFrame was originally inspired by data frames that are in the R programming language. You can think of a DataFrame in pandas as a programmable spreadsheet. One-dimensional sequences of values are stored as a pandas `Series`. A single row or column in a pandas DataFrame is actually a pandas Series. You can think of a pandas Series as a clever list.\n",

For doing that, we can use the `.head()` method of the DataFrame object that will, by default, return the first five rows of the DataFrame.

As the name suggests, `.loc[]` selects data based on axis labels (row and column labels). This alone does not necessarily tell much to you at this point, but `.loc[]` makes it possible to conduct more specific selections, such as allowing you to choose which columns are chosen when selecting a subset of rows. It also makes possible to benefit from row labels that are not necessarily sequential numbers (as has been the case with all our examples thus far). For instance, you can make selections for rows indexed by dates or timestamps. Hence, `.loc[]` can become very handy when working with time series data (we will learn more about this later). Let's now test out the `.loc[]` label indexer by selecting values from column `TEMP` from rows `0`-`5`."

    "Another common way of selecting rows from a DataFrame is to provide a list of values that are used for finding matching rows in a specific DataFrame column. For example, selecting rows that match specific dates can be done by passing a list of values used as criteria to the [`.isin()` function of pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.isin.html). This will go through each value in the selected column (in this case `DATE`) and check whether there is a match or not. As an output, the `.isin()` function returns a `Series` of Boolean values (True or False) that can be combined with `.loc[]` to do the final selection that returns only rows that meet the selection criteria.

    "When doing data analysis, another quite typical operation that needs to be done is to convert values in a column from one data type to another, such as from floating point values to integers. For values stored in a pandas Series, we can use the `.astype()` method for converting data types. Let's explore this by converting the `FMTM` column (type `float64`) to integers (type `int64`). Let's first have a look at the existing data. Since the `FMTM` column has many missing values, so we use `.notna()` to select the rows with valid data only."

    "## Resampling time series data\n",
    "\n",
    "One common task when doing time series data analysis is to `resample` the time series from one frequency to another, such as aggregating daily temperature observations to monthly averages. We will learn how to use resampling functionalities in pandas to conduct both downsampling (i.e., aggregating values) and upsampling based on specific `interpolation` methods. In general, when doing interpolation values that are missing between observations can be estimated using on specific criteria, such as taking the average between two consecutive observations. For instance, you could interpolate hourly temperature observations to calculate estimates at a 30-minute frequency by assuming that the temperature between two times, such as 10:00 and 11:00, is the average of both, giving you an estimate of the temperature at 10:30. Notice that whenever interpolating/upsampling data, you are basically making an \"informed guess\" and there is always uncertainty involved with your estimate.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by downsampling our observations into monthly averages. To do this, we can use the `.resample()` method. The .resample() method works somewhat similarly to `.groupby()`, but it uses the `DatetimeIndex` to allow you to easily control how the values should be grouped. Notice, however, that this only works with time series data (i.e., you need to make sure that you have a DatetimeIndex for your DataFrame). Whenever resampling data, you typically want to combine it with a specific aggregation method, such as .mean(), .max(), or .min(), which will then specify how you want to aggregate the data, such as calculating the monthly averages."

Linear interpolation estimates the missing values between known points by fitting a straight line between the observations. Thus, the interpolated temperature between two consecutive days is the average of the two (similar to the case discussed at the beginning of this section). Let's have a look at an example of interpolating temperatures to a frequency of 12 hours from our daily observations."

    "The calculation of rolling statistics is yet another useful technique to deal with time series data that is \"noisy\" or that has gaps between observations. Calculating a moving average is a typical rolling statistics operation in which observations are weighted (averaged) over a moving \"window\", which is an efficient way to smooth the data and reduce variance between observations. For example, stock market data or GPS observations of the movement / speed of vehicles are good examples of datasets that typically have large amounts of variance, which can make it challenging to see patterns without smoothing. \n",
    "\n",
    "pandas supports various moving window functions, and each have differences in how they influence the end result. Some use a static window size and weigh the observations equally, whereas others can give more weight to more recent observations, for example. In the following we will see how a moving average can be calculated with pandas, and how it influences the interpretations of our data. Let's start by making a plot based on the maximum daily temperature from 1990 onwards."

To do this, we can use the `.rolling()` method, which takes an integer number as an argument by default to specify how many observations should be grouped together (i.e., the window size). By chaining the `.mean()` command after `.rolling()`, we can specify that we want to calculate the average temperature based on those four observations."

    "As output here, we get a Series in which time is the index and the newly calculated moving-window average temperatures are the values. As can be seen in this example, the first three temperature values are NaN, which is expected because we specified that the average should always be based on four consecutive observations. Thus, the average cannot be calculated for the first three observations, and pandas returns NaN.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, it is important to note that `.rolling()` and `.resample()` work similarly, but also have differences. The main difference is that the .rolling() will maintain the number of observations in the data (but change the values according neighboring values, for example based on the mean), whereas .resample() will actually aggregate and reduce the number of observations that will be stored in the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "With our data set, we are fortunate that we are working with observations at regular intervals (daily), but this is not always the case. In situations where the observations are made at irregular time intervals (e.g., several times per day at irregular intervals) using a moving window with a set number of observations can result in unwanted consequences and errors in the analysis. This issue can be handled by passing a `DateOffset` as an argument in the `.rolling()` function, similar to how we did earlier when resampling our data. If the observations occur more frequently than daily, you might use a fixed window size of one day by passing `\"1D\"` to the function. This will keep the time span equal, no matter how many observations there would be recorded within a single day. Note, however, that the time interval being used should be equal, so values such as `\"1MS\"` for monthly intervals would not be consistent since the number of days in a month varies.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, we can use this approach to easily calculate rolling statistics with different window sizes, such as weekly, monthly or even annual averages. We can do this by specifying a varying number of days for the moving window. To demonstrate the influence of \"smoothing\" our time series based on different moving window sizes, let's calculate the moving average of temperatures based on window sizes of 180 days and 360 days (roughly one year), and plot the results."

    "As a result, we have three different lines showing how the raw daily temperature observations (blue line) compare to those smoothed for roughly half a year (orange line) or one year (green line). The daily values show how much temperature varies day to day in our data set, while yearly values roughly show how much temperatures vary from year to year. As we can observe, the variance between observations is reduced (i.e., smoothed) when the size of the window is larger. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is worthwhile to note two other common rolling statistical calculations that can be done using pandas. First, it is possible to use exponentially weighted (EW) window functions to give more weight to observations that are closer to the center of the window (closer in time in our case) using a decay function. The pandas method `.ewm()` can be used for this as described in the [pandas documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.ewm.html). Second, in addition to the moving window functions, pandas provides a method called `.expanding()`, which increases the size of the window for each observation until it encompasses the whole series. This method basically accumulates the information on each observation, similar to cumulative summing, and can be useful in some predictive applications where cumulative information about the given phenomena can provide more accurate results using more observations, for example. More information about the `.expanding()` method can be found in the [pandas documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.expanding.html)."
